Welcome to this experiment.

On each trial you will first briefly see a picture 
(a face, a letter, or a house)

You need to remember these pictures during a short delay. 

After this delay you will see a circle of 6 pictures. 
Your task is to judge whether the picture you remembered
is among these pictures.

If you found it, click the left button.
If it is not there, click the right button.

Try to respond as fast but also as accurate as possible.
