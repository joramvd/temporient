This was the end of the practice block.
Now the real experiment will start.

We will measure EEG, so try to sit still.
Also, try to blink your eyes only in between trials.

If you have any questions, this is the time to ask!

In the next NBLOCKS blocks of NTRIALS trials,
you will receive a 'cue' that symbolizes
the time you have to wait before the search task.

You will only receive feedback about your average
performance after each block.

Are you ready?
