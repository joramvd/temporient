Now the picture you memorized was absent, so right was the correct button.

You may have noticed that you needed to memorize the picture for a
longer period of time than during the first trial.

During the remainder of the experiment, the search task will sometimes
come early, and sometimes come late.

In one half of the experiment, a symbol before each trial will inform
you about this. In the other half, you never know if the search task
will come early or late. You will practice these two versions of the task.

During the whole experiment, at every trial, always try to remember the picture
as good as possible.

So again:

Keep one picture in mind for a short or long delay
Find it in the circle of 6 pictures

Press left it it's there.
Press right if it's not.

Press a button to continue.
