Now the picture you memorized was absent, so right was the correct button.

You may have noticed that you needed to memorize the picture for a
longer period of time than during the first trial.

During the remainder of the experiment, the search task will sometimes
come early, and sometimes come late. This is either always the same for
every trial in one block; or it is different for each trial in a block,
so that at the start of a trial you do not know if the search task will 
come early or late.

During the whole experiment, at every trial, always try to remember the picture
as good as possible.

So again:

Keep one picture in mind for a short or long delay
Find it in the circle of 6 pictures

Press left it it's there.
Press right if it's not.

Press a button to continue.
